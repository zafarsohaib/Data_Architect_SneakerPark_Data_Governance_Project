SneakerParkâ€™s business has grown rapidly over the past year and it has led to some growing pains. As the number of sellers, buyers, items, and sales increased, the company started running into discrepancies between systems which resulted in mischarges, lost revenue, and frustrated customers. With this in mind, Sneaker Park has decided to invest in an Enterprise Data Management program to gain better visibility and control over their data systems.

Phase 1 of this initiative focuses on creating the foundational data management tools and artifacts that will allow SneakerPark to better manage its data now and in the future. More specifically, this entails documenting SneakerPark's data systems, setting up a data catalog, designing better data quality and master data management processes, and formalizing data governance roles.

As a newly hired Data Architect, you are asked to technically lead the Enterprise Data Management Program and get started with the implementation of Phase 1.

The company plans to expand on this foundation in Phase 2 and build out an Enterprise Data Warehouse solution to replace the existing legacy data warehouse, MS Access databases, and excel reports. Phase 2 is a separate initiative and therefore is not a part of this project.
